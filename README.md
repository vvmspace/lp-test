# lp-test

*As I said before - I worked with AWS, not GCP. Checked ways like **gcloud**, **serverless gcp provider** and **expressjs usage** So I hope that I'll have opportunity to discuss this code.*

## Local launch

```bash
cd functions && npm run serve 
```

## Deployment

```bash
firebase deploy
```
